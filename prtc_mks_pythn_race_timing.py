#Each day, you run 10 km, and want to know how long, on average, that run
#takes. Write a program that asks the user how long it took to run 10 km today.
#The programs continues to ask how long (in minutes) it took, until the user
#presses Enter. At that point, the program exitsâ€”but only after calculating
#and displaying the average time that the 10 km run took.
#
#For example, here is what the program would look like if the user enters
#three data points:
#
#Enter 10 km run time: 15
#Enter 10 km run time: 20
#Enter 10 km run time: 10
#Enter 10 km run time:
#Average of 15.0, over 3 races
