(Compute the volume of a cylinder) Write a program that reads in the radius and
length of a cylinder and computes the area and volume using the following formulas:
area = radius * radius * Ï€
volume = area * length
Here is a sample run:
Enter the radius and length of a cylinder:5.5, 12
The area is 95.0331
The volume is 1140.4
